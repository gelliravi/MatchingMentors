Work that I've done towards finding an algorithm to find the optimal solution
for the following problem:

There exist 2 groups of people of size N; one is a group of pupils, and the
other is a group of mentors. Each mentor has a list of length X (I'll solve the
arbitrary length case later) that defines their preferred list of pupils. Each
pupil has a list of length X that defines their list of preferred mentors. A
solution is defined as a set of assignments such that each pupil is assigned to
a different mentor. The score of the solution is the sum of the scores for each
person, such that the score of person 'p' is defined as following:

score(p, o): X - rank(p, o)

such that

rank(p, o): The rank of person 'o' in the list of person 'p',

such that

The rank of the most preferred person is 0, then 1, then 2, and so forth. If
person 'o' does not appear in the list, then the score is 0.
